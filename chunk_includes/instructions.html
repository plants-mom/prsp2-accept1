<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<p>You will see a series of text fragments. Your task is to indicate how natural these fragments sound to you. On the screen you will see a fragment with a scale underneath it. If you think that the fragment sounds perfectly natural you should give it a "5", if it is a bit odd give it a "4", and so on up to "1" which means that you think the fragment sounds very unnatural.</p>
<p>These instructions will be followed by two training text fragments.</p>
